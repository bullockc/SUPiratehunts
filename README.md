### Setting up with Vagrant

To setup a virtual development environment, make sure you
have [Vagrant] and [VirtualBox] installed.

In a console or command prompt, `cd` to this directory and
run: `vagrant up`

This will download and setup a virtual machine, which may
take some time. When it's done, the rails development server
should be started at localhost:3000 which can be opened in
a web browser.
