### Setting up with Vagrant

To setup a virtual development environment, make sure you
have [Vagrant] and [VirtualBox] installed.

In a console or command prompt, `cd` to this directory and
run: `vagrant up`

This will download and setup a virtual machine, which may
take some time. When it's done, the rails development server
should be started at localhost:3000 which can be opened in
a web browser.

To stop a the vagrant machine, use the command `vagrant halt`. The machine can then be started again with `vagrant up`.

In order to run rails or rake commands through the console, you will need to ssh into the virtual box. This can by done by running `vagrant ssh` in the command line after starting the virtual machine. You can exit your ssh session by running `exit` or pressing Ctrl-D.   

Other relevant vagrant commands: 
`reload`: restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
`resume`: resume a suspended vagrant machine
`status`: outputs status of the vagrant machine
`suspend`: suspends the machine rather than closing it entirely
